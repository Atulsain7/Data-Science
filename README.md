# Data-Science<br>
This repository mostly contains tabular data analysis.
Here, ML techniques `Only` to analyze and modelling is utilized,
`It should not be taken as production ready code.` 

### This repository is divided in given sections.

**1. Supervised machine learning**

    This section contains Supervised machine learning techniques.

| File | Problem statement | Description |
| :--- | :--------------- | :--------- |
| [Linear Regression_fs-1](Supervised_ML/Linear_Regression-fs-1.ipynb) | Demonstate basic linear regression on arbritrary data | Simple linear regression is demonstrated on random generated data, however this data doesn't mimic actual one. |
| [Linear Regression Car Resell Price Prediction](Supervised_ML/Linear_regression_Car_Resell_Price_Prediction.ipynb) | Predict Car Resell price with given features of Car | Use linear regression with relaxing the assumptions required to use linear regression, Use standard Scaler to scale the data for efficient model training |
| [Multiple Linear Regression without Scaling](Supervised_ML/Multiple_Linear_Regression_with_Sklearn.ipynb) | Use linear regression to predict GPA based on SAT Score and a random feature, and check whether this feature is useful or not | Use linear regression and find P-values of both features. |
| [Multiple Linear Regression with Standard Scaler](Supervised_ML/Multiple_linear_regression_with_standardization.ipynb) | Use Standard scaler to Train model on GPA_SAT dataset | Use Standard Scaler to transform the data into scaled one. |
| [Underfitting and Overfitting](Supervised_ML/OF_UF_explained_with_Polynominal_regression.ipynb) | Demonstrate underfitting and overfitting and methods to rectify. | Use food classification dataset and avoid overfitting with upsampling. Use Weather dataset to and avoid underfitting with polynominal regression. |
